        <p>Hi, I'm Yunus, a math graduate student at University of Wisconsin, Madison.</p>
        <p>My university email is tuncbilek@wisc.edu. </p> 
        I am in the second year of the Ph.D. program.
        My advisor is Simon Marshall.
        I have not decided on a research topic yet.

<div class="container p-3 my-3 border">
        <p>Before moving to Madison, I was at Yale University between 2014 and 2019. 
        During the first four of those five years, I got my Bachelor of Science in computer science and mathematics. 
        Then I did a post-baccalaureate year to work with Yale economists Costas Arkolakis and Fabian Eckert, with whom I created a model for predicting coffee demand in NYC. 
        In the same year, I worked with School of Management Professor Peter Schott and Fabian to test whether the Census Bureau was randomizing enough of its data to hide the private information of American companies.
        Before those research projects, I worked at Yale's Social Robotics Lab and did a study abroad program in Berlin. </p>

        <p>I am planning to turn this website into a LaTeX-compatible blog of my mathematical readings. I would like to code almost all of the website myself, so it might take a while. But it is a lot of fun. </p>
